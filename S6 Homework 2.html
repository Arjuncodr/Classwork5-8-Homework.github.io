<h2>More Facts</h2>
<ol>
<li>Did you know that blue stars are the hottest and brightest stars in Space?</li>
<br>
<li>Did you know that in the observable Universe, the largest black hole is called Ton 618, and it shines as bright as 140 trillion suns?</li>
<br>
<li>Did you know that space is black because everything is moving from the point of where the cosmic egg exploded 13.8 billion years ago?</li>
<br>
<li>Stars come in different colours depending on their temperature. Cooler stars appear red, while hotter stars look blue or white. Our Sun is a medium-hot star, so that’s why it appears yellow</li>
<br>
<li>Light travels incredibly fast, at about 186,282 miles per second, it can go around the Earth 7.5 times a second</li>
<br>
<li>The Sun is over 864,000 miles wide. It’s so big that you could fit 1,300,000 planet Earths inside</li>
<br>
<li>Our solar system, including Earth, is located in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way, about 27,000 light-years away from the centre. And we're moving through space, orbiting the centre of the galaxy</li>
<br>
<li>About 27% of the universe is made up of a mysterious substance called dark matter, and about 68% is dark energy, which is causing the universe's expansion to accelerate. The rest, everything on Earth, everything ever observed with all of our instruments, all normal matter, adds up to less than 5% of the universe</li>
