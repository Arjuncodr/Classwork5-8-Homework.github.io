<i><center>Space is dark, it is really dark in Space. Space is full of different things such as stars, planets, quasers, black holes, galaxies, and solar systems. Space is all in a place called the UNIVERSE. It was made 13.8 billion years ago, and our Solar System was made from a cloud of interstellar gas and dust that collapsed, resulting in a Solar nebula. Our Solar System is in the cluster Orion Spur in the Milky Way. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, and after a few billion years, we are going to crash into the Andromeda Galaxy. Our black hole holds together our Milky Way, it is called Sagittarius*A Star.</i></center>
